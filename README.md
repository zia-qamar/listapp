Here is the assignment:

Consider an example where List has many ListItem.

1. Build a page to create, edit and list all the lists and their list items

2. Display all the items of the list below each list

3. Provide a button called destroy alongside the list and the list items to soft delete the list and their items

4. If the list is destroyed the items should also be destroyed

5. If the items are destroyed the list should not get destroyed

Write the soft delete logic in a module that can be re-used in other models as well.
7. Provide a button called delete alongside the list and the list items to hard delete the list and their items

8. Build another page called trash to list all the list and list items that are soft deleted

9. Provide a button called restore alongside the item/list that is soft deleted. Clicking on the button should restore the list or the list item correspondingly.
